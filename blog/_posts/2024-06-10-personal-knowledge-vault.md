**Streamlit**: <a href="https://knowledge-vault.streamlit.app/">Demo App</a> | 
**Code**: <a href="https://github.com/hovinh/knowledge-vault">Github</a> 

## Motivation

I have been wanting to write a web application to document my learning experience and readily refer to it whenever I need to share it.
The excuse was always the lack of time to build things from the ground up, so I was above the clouds when I learned about **Streamlit**. Streamlit simplifies this process a lot.
If offers a simple web app template, a wide range of text formats (Github-flavored Markdown and LaTex expression), and simple deployment once the app is ready to share. 

Apparently, with such peaks, I quickly rolled up my sleeve and implemented a web template named **Knowledge Vault** for my own usage. 
This page has three cores functionalities: 
1. Organize your content based on topic
2. Searchable with an exact keyword match
3. Rich-text representation leveraged on Streamlit's markdown() feature

Even better, you can get your own website by simply cloning my <a href="https://github.com/hovinh/knowledge-vault">project</a> and deploying it to Streamlit's Community Cloud. 

Here's a sneak peek at the web app:
